# whilelang-reverse
An interpreter for a while-language that implements reverse computation.

This project implements the two **While** languages (serial and parallel) described in the paper "[Reversing Imperative Parallel Programs](https://yagotzirck.github.io/whilelang-reverse/ReversingImperativeParallelPrograms.pdf)", allowing single-step execution at statement level in both directions (forward as well as reverse execution).

While the operational semantics and syntax aren't all applied literally (mostly for practical reasons), the core concepts are still used.

For more info, refer to the documentation in [Github pages](https://yagotzirck.github.io/whilelang-reverse/), to the README files in the **serial** and **parallel** subfolders, and of course to the source code itself.
